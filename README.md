# Datasheet Interpretation

Based on the TEMT6000 datasheet by SparkFun (https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Imaging/TEMT6000.pdf) we infer the exact value of TEMT6000 illuminance as follows.

Figure 1. Collector Light Current vs. Illuminance of the TEMT6000 datasheet shows a logarithmic plot as given below.

In the above plot, we can see a linear relationship between I<sub>ca</sub> and E<sub>v</sub>. That suggests a power-law elationship, which can be described as:
I=kÃ—L<sup>m</sup>
